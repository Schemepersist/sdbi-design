BSD and LGPL 2.0

https://sourceforge.net/projects/unixodbc/

A somewhat healthy one man project, the oldest commit is in August
2019.  But LGPL 2.0.

Projects that use it:

Asterisk PBX, for MySQL access.
dynalogin: two-factor authentication, apparantly for all its persistence, last commit Jan 2017, https://github.com/dynalogin/dynalogin


--------

Common Lisp SQL (CLSQL) appears to have its own, also LGPL, last updated 2016

OpenDBX looks very dead.

https://github.com/GNOME/libgda
https://www.gnome-db.org/

LGPL, spinoff of GNOME, not a lot of databases it supports:

  at the moment supports SQLite (and SQLCipher), MySQL, PostgreSQL,
  MSAccess, Berkeley Db (and is SQL extension), Oracle and JDBC
  (allows access to any database through a JDBC driver), work is in
  progress for other database types (such as Firebird). There is also
  a special feature which allows one to connect to a database hidden
  behind a web server (through specific PHP scripts)

Or see https://github.com/GNOME/libgda/tree/master/providers which
also has LDAP (MDB is Access I think).

Really don't want to tie myself to *anything* from and currently
supported by the GNOME Foundation.

Enforces one type per column: https://wiki.gnome.org/ChooseLibgdaSQLite

If John's concept is to be supported by databases other than SQLite,
we'll have to create a kludge, but we don't want to force that for
SQLite as well.

User libraries/SRFIs that the Schemepersist stack below will support:

John Cowan's Simple SQL

A Scheme version of Clojure's Korma?
