Adopt Perl's influential nomencalture for the low level plimbing:

DBI database interface, what the programmer write to, does not know
query languages or types.

DBD database driver, knows its particular database, is where column
types are converted to and from Scheme dynamic types.  Has two layers,
that and below it which is what talks to the database.

----------------

Rough sketch of DBI API:

(sdbi-connect config [anti-injection-proc]) -> conn

(sdbi-disconnect conn)

(sdbi-query

(sdbi-cursor-magic

(sdbi-execute ... for update, delete, DDL, maybe even works for -literal?  And query??

It needs a general optional? config argument so the programmer can for
example direct that it be prepared, or not depending on the default.

(sdbi-execute-literal string [some magic for returning rows or the like])

transactions ... how to work in clean and not ugly?

how and where to pass through type conversion information for DBD top layer?

Need general, generic pass throughs from DBI to both layers of the DBD.

Existing UNIX friendly general database interface libraries for the
plumbing/physical layer:

Common Lisp SQL (CLSQL) appears to have its own, also LGPL, last updated 2016

OpenDBX looks very dead.

GNOME DB/libgda is hopelessly complicated and buggy, also LGPL, and typed

libdbi no longer under development but very minimally supported, C,
LGPL, and looks typed.  Claims its design is object oriented.  Claims
it's used by Bacula, but half a decade later that's not true.

Typing that you can apply to returned results is cramped, text and
binary strings, imprecisely sized integers [BAD SMELL], floats and
doubles, and "date/time".  Would require serialization.  But looks
like you can apply dynamic typing on the fly.

From the website, would be ~2013-4:

The drivers officially supported by libdbi are:

MySQL
PostgreSQL [ A PostgreSQL building patch was done March 2019. ]
SQLite3

The following drivers are in various stages of completion and are supposed to be included into the next release(tm):

DB2
Firebird/Interbase
FreeTDS (provides access to MS SQL Server and Sybase)
Ingres
mSQL
Oracle

C++: CppDB, SOCI

GPL only: libzdb, sells itself on connection pooling.

Scheme libraries:

guile dbi GPL only.

Gerbil is object oriented like or worse than Gauche: https://github.com/vyzo/gerbil/tree/master/src/std/db

sqlid.plt dead before bzlib/dbi below was developed, not part of Racket library set, LGPL.

PLT bzlib/dbi based on Perl DBI dead, LGPL, was once popular but no longer part of Racket library set, retrieved.

Description-en: framework that helps packages to manage databases
 This package contains the core of the dbconfig-common framework. This
 framework presents a policy and implementation for managing various databases
 used by applications included in Debian packages.
 .
 It can:
  - support MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and SQLite based applications;
  - create or remove databases and database users;
  - access local or remote databases;
  - upgrade/modify databases when upstream changes database structure;
  - generate config files in many formats with the database info;
  - import configs from packages previously managing databases on their own;
  - prompt users with a set of normalized, pre-translated questions;
  - handle failures gracefully, with an option to retry;
  - do all the hard work automatically;
  - work for package maintainers with little effort on their part;
  - work for local admins with little effort on their part;
  - comply with an agreed upon set of standards for behavior;
  - do absolutely nothing if that is the whim of the local admin;
  - perform all operations from within the standard flow of
    package management (no additional skill is required of the local
    admin).
