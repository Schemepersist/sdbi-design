A R6RS and R7RS API for any database with a text query language that returns rectangular results.

By rectangular results, we mean named columns with one or more rows, in SQL style, like this from the NeoJ4 graph database (https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/introduction/):

+----------------------+
| john.name | fof.name |
+----------------------+
| "John"    | "Maria"  |
| "John"    | "Steve"  |
+----------------------+
2 rows
